# sentinel-governance

This is a governance prototype for the Sentinel contract.

It implements the [specification](https://github.com/ewasm/design/blob/master/sentinel.md) proposed on the ewasm design repository.

## Build

Make sure to have Truffle 5.x nightly installed: `npm install -g truffle@next`. It will not work with Truffle 4.x as it depends on Solidity 5.x.
